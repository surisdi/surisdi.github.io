<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  I am a computer vision PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>, under the 
  supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vondrick/">Professor Carl Vondrick</a>, in New York. 
  I am also a Microsoft PhD fellow.
</p>

<p>
My interests are multimodal machine learning, video representations and self-supervised learning, and in general all
the areas of artificial intelligence that involve using all the available information in an intelligent way.
</p>
  <p>
  Before moving to New York, I was a researcher at the 
  <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/">Vector Institute</a>, working in 
<a href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/">Professor Sanja Fidler's lab</a>. I was previously a visiting student at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu">CSAIL-MIT</a>, working in 
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/">Professor Antonio Torralba's lab</a>, and I studied both the 
undergrad and a Master's in telecommunications in the <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en">UPC</a>, in Barcelona. 
I have also been lucky to work at Telefonica with <a href="https://joanserra.weebly.com">Joan Serra</a>, and at 
Adobe with <a href="https://www.justinsalamon.com">Justin Salamon</a> and <a href="https://bryanrussell.org">Bryan Russell</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In my free time, I like to play the classical guitar. Maybe (probably not) some day I'll upload some recording of me playing.
